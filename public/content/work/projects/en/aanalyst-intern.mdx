## Overview

As a Data Analyst Intern, I was responsible for analyzing data and providing insights to help make informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed data and provided insights to help make informed decisions.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to help understand data trends and patterns.
- **Data Modeling**: Developed data models and performed data analysis to identify patterns and trends.
- **Data Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **SnowFlake**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Tableau**: For data analysis and visualization.



## Challenges and Learnings

As this was my first time working with Python for data analysis and visualization, I faced a steep learning curve. The project required me to quickly learn new libraries and frameworks, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, and to apply them to real-world data.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was dealing with the quality of the data. The data was raw and had not been cleaned or processed, which made it difficult to work with. I had to develop a pipeline using Python to clean and process the data, which was a great learning experience.

Another challenge was visualizing the data in a meaningful way. I had to experiment with different visualization tools and techniques to find the best way to communicate the insights I had gained from the data.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about data analysis and visualization, and I gained experience working with new technologies and tools. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of data quality and the challenges of working with real-world data.
