## Overview

As a Data Analyst Intern, I was responsible for analyzing data and providing insights to help make informed decisions. 





## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed data and provided insights to help make informed decisions.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to help understand data trends and patterns.
- **Data Modeling**: Developed data models and performed data analysis to identify patterns and trends.
- **Data Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **SnowFlake**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Tableau**: For data analysis and visualization.




## Challenges and Learnings

- Entering a new domain of data analysis was a challenge in itself, as I had to learn new tools and techniques to work with large datasets.
- Dealing with nearly 50k data points was a challenge, as I had to develop efficient methods to process and analyze the data without sacrificing accuracy.

- I learned how to work with large datasets, including data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- I learned how to use data visualization tools like Tableau to communicate insights effectively.
- I learned how to collaborate with designers to develop a shared design library in Figma.
